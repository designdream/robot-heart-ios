00:00-00:11
talk check check check check check we both good all right um so we need to research communication

00:12-00:21
so you're saying the mesh nodes claude all right first let's do a like a little search in whatever

00:21-00:28
chat bot or about can you tell me about the established mesh network at burning man

00:28-00:30
the mesh communication network at Burning Man.

00:31-00:37
Give me an overview of the established mesh network at Burning Man.

00:44-00:46
Marquine didn't answer.

00:51-00:52
It's all good.

00:53-00:56
There'll be a portal because I saw him do it when I was with him in Vegas.

05:03-05:03
he's black

05:17-05:20
man is putting way too much effort into a simple question

05:24-05:25
four and a half minutes.

05:26-05:26
That's why I like it.

05:27-05:29
We just need a simple overview

05:29-05:32
of what the current state of Mesh Network is.

05:33-05:34
Put that in ChatGPT.

05:35-05:36
We're going to put it in all of them.

05:37-05:39
You're going to have to deal with all of them.

05:41-05:43
ChatGPT is going to give you an overview

05:43-05:44
in about five seconds.

05:55-05:55
Claude

05:56-05:58
perplexity was way faster

05:58-06:00
perplexity was way faster

06:02-06:03
alright but we brought visuals

06:08-06:10
this is actually a good blog post

06:12-06:14
put the same prompt

06:14-06:15
and all of them and time them?

06:16-06:16
- Yep.

06:17-06:18
- And show what each one showed?

06:24-06:28
- The Laura text mesh, burning mesh.

06:28-06:29
Yeah, that's what we want.

06:35-06:38
- How it works, where are they?

06:39-06:41
Practical constraints, burning mesh.

07:01-07:03
We want to build an app for our camp.

07:04-07:07
I usually, I do exploration in ChatGPT.

07:08-07:11
So we want to build an app for our camp.

07:12-07:14
that lets us communicate

07:16-07:19
our locations as well as camp updates?

07:20-07:23
Would we be able to build that app

07:23-07:26
and have it make use of the MeshTactic network?

07:33-07:33
MeshTactics.

07:38-07:41
It's all good. It'll figure it out.

07:46-07:46
yes we can

07:47-07:47
your app won't

07:48-07:48
talk to the

07:48-07:49
mess directly

07:50-07:51
it will talk

07:51-07:51
to a

07:51-07:51
mess-tastic

07:52-07:52
radio node

07:53-07:53
yeah

08:05-08:06
and then

08:06-08:06
we're going to

08:06-08:06
go back to

08:06-08:07
manu's

08:07-08:07
I'm going to

08:07-08:08
keep everybody

08:08-08:09
in parody

08:10-08:11
so that

08:11-08:15
what results we end up with and and this one's still running so i'm going to add it to it

08:17-08:21
okay in midstream all right keep going back to your next iteration

08:31-08:35
it's a pretty harsh environment out there and we're going to be on bicycles and mobile and

08:35-08:41
hanging off of things so we need to be able to make sure that like it's not clunky won't get

08:41-08:45
stuck on anything won't be dangerous doesn't have heavy batteries like we've got to be

08:46-08:49
really really mobile think of us as tactical operators

08:55-09:03
it's just going to give us a list of established mesh hardware that we can use which is helpful

09:08-09:12
We really just need like functionality requirement list from the app.

09:14-09:17
We need to figure out what protocol the app uses to interface with the mesh network.

09:18-09:18
All right.

09:19-09:20
So let's say that again then here.

09:21-09:21
Ready?

09:24-09:30
What we really need are a list of functionality requirements for the app that our camp would use.

09:31-09:40
And then we need to determine what protocol that app will work with to communicate with the mesh-tastic network.

09:41-09:49
And then we need to figure out what mesh hardware will be used for the communication.

09:56-10:04
I like that Whisper automatically puts things into bulleted lists and numbered lists.

10:17-10:19
Perplexity answers really fucking fast.

10:20-10:22
Yeah, I wonder what models they're pinging.

10:24-10:26
Some of the instant models.

10:28-10:33
like we're routing to we're routing to reasoning models or instant based on the question

10:34-10:37
they're routing to instant immediately because it's cheaper

10:41-10:49
i like like i like this response here of all that it said yeah i almost want to give all the ais

10:50-10:56
let's see what's this one say all right so this one oh this one so so at this point do i go close

10:56-11:02
some shit i'll close some shit sorry here a million fucking things i'm like what's going on here bro

11:04-11:09
close close close close close close close close close i'm leaving that one open

11:09-11:10
Samford.

11:13-11:14
Oh, I've got to leave these open.

11:15-11:17
What did I have here open?

11:18-11:20
Close that, close that.

11:21-11:24
Dude, these are the people I'm bringing on here, by the way.

11:25-11:26
So this dude right here?

11:26-11:26
Yep.

11:28-11:30
He worked at the National, let's see.

11:31-11:34
The biggest thing is he did the Bioweapons Department of Defense.

11:35-11:39
DOD, does he talk about developing bioweapons in here?

11:40-11:42
Did I find that somewhere else?

11:43-11:46
Ah, U.S. Omrid military.

11:46-11:50
He worked on vaccine development for BSL-4 viral agents.

11:51-11:51
Hell yeah.

11:52-11:54
This is one of my advisors, bro.

11:55-11:57
I'm putting together a crack team of doctors.

11:58-12:00
My doctors are like the shit.

12:00-12:01
Hell yeah.

12:06-12:07
of being advised by people

12:07-12:09
who have clearance higher than the president.

12:17-12:18
All right.

12:18-12:19
All right, we're good.

12:19-12:21
Let's see what chat GPT said.

12:22-12:23
All right, so chat says...

12:26-12:28
Squad roster, location sharing,

12:29-12:30
low bandwidth tactical,

12:31-12:33
Camp updates that are broadcast out.

12:34-12:36
Reliable UX, safe and simple.

12:37-12:38
Love it.

12:38-12:39
Yeah, that sounds all good.

12:42-12:43
I really like this.

12:44-12:44
Camp infrastructure.

12:46-12:51
TECO, one elevated node, redundant, pure tactical, US camp.

12:52-12:54
Concrete recommended setup for your camp.

12:54-12:58
Every mobile operator, a T1000E personal node.

12:59-13:00
We searched that on just the web.

13:02-13:06
That's like just a product that we would be buying.

13:12-13:15
Yeah, that's what anyone that wants to be.

13:15-13:15
So I fucked up.

13:15-13:16
You had those, right?

13:16-13:18
I bought them, and I didn't buy the E.

13:20-13:22
Or, no, I did buy the E.

13:22-13:24
I didn't buy, there's version 1 through 3.

13:25-13:25
Yeah.

13:25-13:26
And I bought version 2.

13:27-13:27
Yeah.

13:27-13:29
And you need version 3.

13:29-13:29
Okay

13:32-13:33
So then we get

13:33-13:34
Everyone in camp

13:34-13:37
I want to make sure that this is compatible with iPhones

13:40-13:41
Okay

13:42-13:43
So then anyone in camp

13:44-13:46
That wants to be on the network

13:46-13:47
Just gets one of those

13:48-13:49
How much do these cost?

13:50-13:51
Dude I think they're like 30 bucks

13:52-13:54
It's like trivial for our camp

13:56-13:58
Yeah this is the one that bought

13:58-14:01
And we could probably buy them cheaper in bulk off Alibaba.

14:10-14:13
Can you find these cheaper in bulk if I need to buy like 100 of them?

14:28-14:29
I'm going to Alibaba right now.

14:35-14:37
Oh, these are like the supplier suppliers.

14:38-14:38
Look at that.

14:40-14:41
No, they're more expensive here.

14:45-14:47
I'm sorry, I forgot to text you the address.

14:47-14:47
Hold on.

14:47-14:48
398 Pennsylvania.

14:49-14:50
You got some badges.

14:50-14:51
How long are you guys going to be there?

14:53-14:53
I'm not going anywhere.

14:54-14:56
Until, are you going to the MoMA at four?

14:57-15:00
Lauren hasn't confirmed MoMA at four yet, so until four?

15:02-15:03
Okay, all right.

15:03-15:04
Maybe longer.

15:04-15:07
Lauren's up at the house we were at yesterday.

15:07-15:08
I don't know where she's at.

15:08-15:10
She's hanging out with Willa

15:11-15:12
up in

15:13-15:14
Restoration Hardware.

15:16-15:16
Okay.

15:17-15:18
I'll see you later. Bye.

15:19-15:19
Alright, bye.

15:20-15:22
$10 minimum order, size $100.

15:25-15:26
We can definitely get them cheap.

15:37-15:39
That feels almost too cheap, though.

15:50-15:51
How much are they?

15:52-15:53
I found them on Alibaba.

15:53-15:57
This says 10 bucks if you do minimum order size 100.

16:00-16:01
That's great.

16:02-16:03
I'm even fine at 40.

16:05-16:05
Yeah.

16:06-16:08
So, you and I need one where you're at.

16:10-16:12
So, we need to order two of these right now.

16:15-16:16
Buy.

16:16-16:17
In stock, right?

16:17-16:18
You get one.

16:18-16:19
We'll get three of them.

16:19-16:21
Yeah, they'd be fun for us to fuck around with, at least.

16:23-16:24
Let's check out.

16:32-16:33
I don't want to use my chicken.

16:34-16:35
Let me order.

16:35-16:35
Oh, wait.

16:36-16:36
Where's my mailing address?

16:39-16:39
Fuck.

16:42-16:43
Too quick on the draw.

16:44-16:45
Oh, good.

16:45-16:45
I didn't order yet.

16:50-16:50
Change.

16:52-16:53
Where do we want to ship this?

16:53-16:53
God damn it.

16:55-16:56
Jesus Christ, Felipe.

16:59-17:02
That's the fucking drug dealer's list of addresses right there.

17:04-17:05
That was hilarious.

17:06-17:07
that is not a normal number

17:09-17:10
it's not built for me bro

17:12-17:13
my user experience

17:14-17:14
everywhere is terrible

17:16-17:17
that was hilarious

17:19-17:19
it's like

17:20-17:21
40 addresses

17:27-17:28
that was great

17:29-17:29
oh shit

17:30-17:32
oh my god

17:33-17:34
that is

17:34-17:36
I'd never even thought about that.

17:40-17:41
The problem with screening.

17:42-17:43
Screaming your screen.

17:43-17:44
Wait, what am I doing?

17:44-17:45
I don't want...

17:48-17:49
What am I missing?

17:49-17:50
Oh, you got to pick a method.

17:53-17:53
From the China warehouse?

17:54-17:57
That's going to take fucking three weeks to get here.

17:57-17:58
Those ones.

18:01-18:03
I think we can get these

18:03-18:05
the same price on Amazon

18:05-18:06
and be here in two days.

18:07-18:07
Really?

18:08-18:08
Yeah.

18:08-18:09
That's why,

18:09-18:11
this is where I went wrong last time, bro.

18:13-18:14
Okay, what's it called?

18:15-18:16
T1000-E.

18:17-18:18
T1000.

18:18-18:19
This is, dude.

18:22-18:24
Oh, they're 50 bucks on Amazon.

18:25-18:26
Bro, we already got it

18:27-18:28
already connected right there.

18:30-18:31
We're good.

18:32-18:34
these ones would be here in two days

18:37-18:39
what's this DHL two days

18:41-18:42
support the guys that make it

18:44-18:46
I don't think those are the guys that make it

18:48-18:48
let's do it

18:49-18:51
you're such an asshole bro what are you talking about

18:51-18:53
these are the guys that have the repo

18:53-18:54
look check this out

19:00-19:01
check their github

19:01-19:01
bro.

19:03-19:04
I put a P on there.

19:06-19:07
Where's our GitHub, bro?

19:09-19:11
I mean, dude, who doesn't want

19:11-19:13
to support this website? Look at this, bro.

19:14-19:15
Alright, alright.

19:16-19:17
Like, this

19:17-19:19
guy put time into this. Do you know how happy

19:19-19:21
I am looking at this right here? NVIDIA? Oh, it's

19:21-19:22
got a spark right here.

19:23-19:24
Look at all the shit I need right here.

19:25-19:26
Alright, alright.

19:28-19:29
I don't know. It's not supporting local,

19:29-19:31
but it's... There's an open source dexterous hand.

19:31-19:40
pretty cool yeah but they have a github dude look at their support support discord forum

19:42-19:50
all right and uh and where's a document what's this site um it's a seedstudio.com

19:53-19:59
look at this bro okay this is why i want to give them the money

20:04-20:04
because

20:06-20:07
they are like

20:07-20:07
they do like

20:08-20:08
sensors and like

20:09-20:09
open source hardware

20:09-20:10
development

20:10-20:11
bro look at this

20:13-20:14
how cool is this

20:14-20:14

20:25-20:26
yeah that's sweet

20:26-20:26
alright

20:27-20:27
yeah yeah

20:28-20:29
Facial recognition.

20:29-20:31
I'm going through their new gear, new start right now.

20:31-20:32
New year, new year.

20:35-20:36
Facial recognition.

20:39-20:39
On edge.

20:45-20:46
All right, there it is.

20:47-20:48
Terminal.

20:50-20:54
And now, I can take AI to come and grab all this information

20:54-20:56
and pull this YouTube video down

20:56-20:57
and fucking suck it up

20:57-20:58
on my laptop

20:58-20:59
and read the screens

20:59-21:00
throughout this entire thing.

21:01-21:02
That's sick.

21:06-21:06
All right, anyway,

21:06-21:07
I'm going to have a check out.

21:08-21:08
I'm not letting you

21:09-21:09
fucking sway me.

21:09-21:10
That's bullshit.

21:10-21:11
These guys are good people.

21:12-21:14
All right, all right, all right.

21:14-21:15
It's $12.

21:15-21:16
If it's two days late,

21:17-21:17
it's five days late,

21:17-21:18
I am loyal.

21:21-21:22
No, I would order it from Amazon

21:23-21:23
if it was here tomorrow,

21:25-21:26
but...

21:26-21:27
that would be

21:27-21:27
terrible

21:30-21:30
check out

21:34-21:35
do we want anything else from there?

21:37-21:37
I don't think so

21:38-21:39
they have such cool stuff like the tracker

21:40-21:41
pro I've been looking at for a long time

21:43-21:46
I'm looking at some of their robot arms right now

21:48-21:50
I've ordered from you guys before

21:50-21:51
we got password

22:01-22:02
Where's our food at?

22:07-22:08
Oh, it's already at the door, bro.

22:11-22:11
Food here.

22:14-22:15
Let's go get it.

22:16-22:16
Hell yeah.

22:17-22:18
Fuck yeah.

22:20-22:21
Where's our food at?

22:21-22:21
Here.

22:22-22:23
Alright, we gotta pause our mic.

22:24-22:24
Yeah.

22:26-22:27
Did they just leave it out front?

22:34-22:34
Yeah, it's out front.

22:35-22:36
It's on the tour set.

22:36-22:37
Where's Piazza?

22:37-22:41
San Francisco, where things don't last over the tour set very well.

22:42-22:42
Hmm.
