# Social Capital: A Trust-Based Alternative Economy

## Vision

**Social Capital is not points. It's proof of who you are.**

In a world where traditional systems can fail—internet outages, economic collapse, government instability—communities need a way to organize, coordinate, and trust each other. Social Capital provides that foundation.

This isn't gamification. This isn't about winning. This is about building a **network of reliable people** who can count on each other when it matters most.

## Philosophy

### Why "Social Capital" Instead of "Points"

| Points | Social Capital |
|--------|----------------|
| Competitive | Collaborative |
| Can be gamed | Earned through action |
| Resets each event | Persists for life |
| About winning | About trust |
| Extrinsic motivation | Intrinsic value |
| Zero-sum | Positive-sum |

**Points** make people ask: *"How do I get more than others?"*

**Social Capital** makes people ask: *"How do I become someone others can rely on?"*

## How Social Capital Works

### Earning Capital

Social Capital is earned through **verified contributions**:

| Action | Capital Earned | Verification |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Complete a shift | 10-30 | Lead confirmation + location |
| Complete a critical task (P1) | 15 | Peer witness |
| Complete an important task (P2) | 10 | Lead confirmation |
| Complete a normal task (P3) | 5 | Self-report + photo |
| Help in emergency | 25 | Multiple witnesses |
| Mentor a new member | 10 | Mentee confirmation |
| Organize an event | 20 | Attendance count |

### Losing Capital

Capital can be **lost through unreliability**:

| Action | Capital Lost | Impact |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| No-show to shift | -20 | Reliability score drops |
| Abandon task | -10 | Trust level may drop |
| Pattern of no-shows | -50 | May lose privileges |

### Capital Never Expires

Unlike points that reset, Social Capital is **permanent**:
- Earned at Burning Man 2024? Still valid in 2030.
- Built trust at a regional burn? Carries to the main event.
- Proved reliable at off-season events? Known at the next one.

## The Trusted Network

### What It Is

The Trusted Network is a **decentralized web of reliable people**. When you prove yourself reliable, you become part of this network. Others in the network can:

- See your trust level
- Vouch for you to new communities
- Request your help for critical tasks
- Include you in high-trust activities

### Network Effects

## Economic Potential

### Beyond Points: A Real Economy

Social Capital could evolve into a **trust-based economic system**:

#### Phase 1: Internal Camp Economy
- Capital determines shift priority
- High-capital members get first choice
- Creates incentive to contribute

#### Phase 2: Inter-Community Exchange
- Capital recognized across communities
- "Reliable at Robot Heart" means something at other camps
- Trust becomes portable

#### Phase 3: Service Exchange
- Members offer skills/services
- Capital used as "payment"
- No fiat currency needed

#### Phase 4: Resource Allocation
- Limited resources distributed by capital
- Fair allocation based on contribution
- Prevents hoarding

#### Phase 5: Alternative Economy
- Full economic activity possible
- Trade goods and services
- Works without traditional banking

---

## Disaster Resilience

### When Traditional Systems Fail

In a scenario where internet, banking, or government services become unreliable:

| Traditional System | Social Capital Alternative |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Bank accounts | Capital stored locally on device |
| Credit scores | Trust levels verified by network |
| Government ID | Cryptographic identity |
| Currency | Capital as medium of exchange |
| Contracts | Peer-witnessed commitments |
| Insurance | Community mutual aid |

### Mesh Network Foundation

The app already supports:
- **BLE mesh**: Phone-to-phone communication
- **LoRa mesh**: Long-range radio communication
- **Offline-first**: Works without internet
- **Local storage**: Data persists on device
- **Cryptographic identity**: Secure, verifiable

This infrastructure means the Social Capital system can operate **completely independently** of traditional infrastructure.

## Anti-Gaming Measures

### Why Gaming Is Hard

| Attack | Prevention |
|--------|------------|
| Fake accounts | Device binding, invite-only |
| Fake shifts | Multi-party verification |
| Collusion | Random spot checks, anomaly detection |
| Identity theft | Cryptographic signatures |
| Capital inflation | Fixed earning rates, no purchasing |

### Key Principle: Capital Cannot Be Bought

**You cannot buy Social Capital.** Period.

- No in-app purchases
- No transfers between users
- No conversion from fiat currency
- Only earned through verified action

This makes it fundamentally different from any currency that can be accumulated through wealth.

## Social Movement Potential

### The 10 Principles as Foundation

Robot Heart is built on the **10 Principles of Burning Man**:

1. **Radical Inclusion** → Anyone can earn capital
2. **Gifting** → Capital earned by giving, not taking
3. **Decommodification** → Capital can't be bought
4. **Radical Self-reliance** → You earn your own trust
5. **Radical Self-expression** → Your contributions define you
6. **Communal Effort** → Network grows through collaboration
7. **Civic Responsibility** → Accountability is public
8. **Leaving No Trace** → Sustainable, not extractive
9. **Participation** → Capital requires active involvement
10. **Immediacy** → Trust built through present action

### Scaling the Movement

## Conclusion

Social Capital is more than a feature. It's a **foundation for a new kind of social organization**—one based on trust, contribution, and mutual aid rather than wealth, status, or power.

In a world of increasing uncertainty, the ability to know who you can count on is invaluable. Social Capital makes that knowledge portable, verifiable, and resilient.

**This isn't about points. This is about building a network of people who show up for each other.**
